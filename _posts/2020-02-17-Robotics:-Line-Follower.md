# Introduction

For this project I have used CV2 in Phyton for image processing and different logic methods for robots. First, I have used the most basic of all, case-based programming. The next method of implementation will be through a PID controller. I will be updating this post with the new changes in my proyect.

## What case-based programming is

Case-based control is a relatively simple reactive system. It is an Artificial Intelligence methodology to carry out learning that has achieved good results in many fields of application. As features, a case-based control:
    路 Iterative operation (fast iterations)
    路 Situation correspondence table
    路 Allows to react to unforeseen events
    路 Time does not influence. it's "here and now"
